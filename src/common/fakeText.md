# Levels / Stages 

Here are some ideas for the first few levels we discussed in our last meeting. Please feel free to add or update these if you think I missed anything!


## Level 1

Objective: to collect a set of exactly three shapes that add up to 15.
Progression of Play: on your turn, choose a shape that has not been chosen by either player. You now control that shape. Cross it off the list of numbers, and write the number on your side of the shape to show that it is now yours.


## Level 2

Objective: to destroy outlier shapes in the set of 15 that do not match your selected color. 
Progression of Play: on your turn, select a color that has not been chosen by either player. For this level only you now control that color . It will auto selct from the task bar, and write the color on your side of the shape to show that it is set.


## Level 3

Objective: to alter color to coordinate with enemy shape locaitons.
Progression of Play: on your turn, follow the map to guide your shape to the colored flag in enemy boundries that has not been chosen by either player. You now control that shape. Cross it off the list of numbers, and write the number on your side of the shape to show that it is now yours.â€™



Game Mechanics

Here is a quick sketch that we mocked up in the meeting yesterday. Just to recap, if the cursor stays fixed in the center of the window, the user will have to rotate and tilt the device on the x and y axis to select the different objects that show up in the scene.
